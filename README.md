# Handwash-Detector
This project is a real-time Handwash Detection System that classifies actions as "Washing Hands" or "Not Washing Hands" using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch. The system processes both images and videos and provides visual feedback with confidence levels.
